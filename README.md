# DynamicReactiveForm

Project is mainly composed of 3 folders:

- _demo-without-dynamic-form_, which is an **application** rendering a form in the "usual" way
- _demo-with-dynamic-form_, which is an **application** rendering a form starting from a configuration
- _dynamic-reactive-form_, which is a **library** rendering form in a dynamic way
